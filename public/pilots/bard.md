## Pilot Biography

As a soldier of fortune, you lived by the motto, “have gun, will travel.” You and your kit were available to the highest bidder. 

Borek has never stayed in one place long as he jumped from Mercenary Crew to Mercenary Crew over the years, always traveling alone but able to join and fit in with Crews as he joined up. He was always hesitant to get too close with his Crew Mates after losing a whole squad in one of his first solo Mercenary deployments.

He wont put his neck on the line for a hopeless cause and avoids no win situations. Always more willing to see another day and earn another pay check. His up beat persona and optimism masks his cautionary attitude and fear of taking chances.

Prior to being a mercenary Borek grew up in the Carpathian Line as an amateur Soccer player. Never quiet good enough to get on a professional team he joined a Mercenary Company and worked his way to a mech license. Eventually he parted ways after a dust up and joined with his first solo merc crew, which was quickly wiped out on a mission gone sideways, leaving him to flee in disgrace.
