# Armada Insurgency H.M.S. Nermal Logs // 6∆.9∑ø.5014u

Armada Insurgency dispatched a security force of what appeared to be ancient hybrid bio-mechanical mechs before departing the ancient city/island of Lardossia. After a meetup with the researcher Skip from Phoenix-2, Kenjiro was entrusted to the researcher along with other discovered Lardossian artifacts. Skip informed them of an opportunity to take down the FZC's omninet firewall.

After taking down the firewall, Armada Insurgency sent a message out informing the galaxy of the Free Zone Collective's various human rights violations. The Armada Insurgency heard back from Union stating that additional peacekeeping forces are en route.
