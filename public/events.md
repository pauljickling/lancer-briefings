Armada Insurgency prepared for the arrival of allied forces by constructing a space port on Ossidana. Additionally, Armada Insurgency attempted to expand its ranks, but this came with complications.

Before capturing the military command center on Talay, the Armada Insurgency destroyed the flash clone facility the FZC was using to procure large forces of infantry.

After seizing the command center on Talay, the Armada Insurgency gained valuable intel on the whereabouts of important members of the FZC. After making contact with allied forces, conflicts emerged with the assisting mercenary company, the Shadow Tigers. A plan was devised for Armada Insurgency to eliminate one of the key FZC members, Atticus Raylon.
