# Armada Insurgency H.M.S. Nermal Logs // 6∆.9∑ø.5014u

Armada Insurgency explored an aquatic city that had been uninhabited for over two thousand years. Kenjiro stuck his hand somewhere he shouldn't have, and was killed and turned into some sort of bio-computer. 

Explorations revealed the **Smith-Shimano Corporation** had been conducting bio-industrial research in a separate facility underwater. During explorations operatives acquired a globe that appeared to be some sort of weapon interface. Exiting the mission area involved jury rigging the power supply for the elevator, but this set off alarms and triggered some ancient mechs that emerged from the city and began ascending to the surface. Armada operatives rushed to their mechs in anticipation of the engagement.
